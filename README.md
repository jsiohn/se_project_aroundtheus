# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

This project is called Around the US! It is a site built to practice responsive web design. Using a Figma concept design, the page was created to match certain aspects in a desktop and mobile browser view with some transitions in between screen sizes. Changing the size of the browser window should yield the desired results that match the concept.
